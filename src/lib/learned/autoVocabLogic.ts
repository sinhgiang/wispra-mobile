/**
 * Pure logic of the vocabulary Wispra learns by itself from the user's History and finished
 * meetings — no Electron, no file access. Persistence, caching and IPC live in autoVocab.ts.
 *
 * This is the one place the app learns without being told, so it is deliberately gentle. What it
 * finds is only ever handed to the speech recogniser as a spelling to prefer; it is never used to
 * rewrite text (that stays with the user's own corrections, see lexiconLogic.ts), and it is never
 * given to the AI cleanup as "keep this exactly" — an entrenched mistake would then also stop the
 * AI from fixing it. Two signals, both from the user's own text:
 *  - seen:  a name/brand/acronym that keeps turning up in what the user dictates
 *  - fixed: the AI cleanup keeps turning one spelling into another look-alike one
 *           ("Cloud" → "Claude"): the cleanup step knows more than the recogniser did
 *
 * The risk is that History holds the recogniser's own output, so a recurring WRONG spelling looks
 * exactly like a recurring right one. Four guards: a spelling the AI keeps correcting is never
 * learned as-is; a look-alike of a well-known name ("Cloud" for "Claude", see wellKnownNames.ts) is
 * never learned; two look-alike spellings that are about equally common cancel each other out
 * instead of one being picked; and whatever is learned is listed for the user to keep or remove.
